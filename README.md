This project explores the **London Bike Sharing Dataset** from Kaggle and prepares it for further analysis (for tools like Tableau).

- Used **Kaggle API** to download the dataset directly into my local environment:
  ```bash
  !kaggle datasets download -d hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset
  ```
- Extracted the downloaded `.zip` file.
- Selected only the **relevant columns** by creating a **dictionary** mapping.
- Converted specific **integer columns** into **string** format for better readability.
- Finally, **exported** the cleaned and transformed data into an **Excel file (`.xlsx`)** for further use in visualization tools like **Tableau**.

## ğŸ›  Libraries Used
